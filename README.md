# Assembly-Language
Assembly language, also known as assembler language, is a low-level programming language that’s designed to communicate instructions with specific computer hardware and direct the flow of information. It does this using human-readable mnemonics (consisting of mnemonics like “LDA” to represent load accumulator) to form short code that makes it easier for the person trying to complete the work. These short codes are converted into machine learning language (binary, i.e., 1s and 0s) through the use of programs called assemblers.
